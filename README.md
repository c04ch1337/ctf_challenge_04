# CTF Challenge 4: The Enigma Server

## Story
A rogue server has been discovered, hosting a mix of web, SSH, and SSL services. This server is believed to be a testing ground for a cybercriminal organization. Your mission is to infiltrate the server, exploit its vulnerabilities, and retrieve 10 hidden flags. Each flag represents a piece of encrypted data that can expose the organization's operations.

## Objective
Find all 10 flags hidden in the server. Each flag is associated with a vulnerability from the OWASP Top 100 list or equivalent SSH/SSL vulnerabilities. Use your skills to exploit these vulnerabilities and retrieve the flags.
